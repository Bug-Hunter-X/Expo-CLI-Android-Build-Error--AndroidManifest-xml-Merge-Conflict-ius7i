The solution involves carefully examining your `app.json` file and ensuring it aligns correctly with the package name and other details within the Android project.  If you've manually edited the `AndroidManifest.xml` file, double-check all attributes for conflicts. If possible, revert to the default Expo configuration for `AndroidManifest.xml` to see if this resolves the issue. If the problem persists, try cleaning the project's build cache and trying again:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
expo build:android
```

In some cases, it may be necessary to explicitly define certain attributes in `app.json` to avoid conflicts. For example, make sure the `android.package` attribute matches the package name used throughout your Android project.  Consult the Expo documentation for the correct configuration of `app.json` for your project.
