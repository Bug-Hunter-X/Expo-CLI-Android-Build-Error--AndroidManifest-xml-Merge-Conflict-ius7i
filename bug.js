This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves a problem with the AndroidManifest.xml file.  The specific error message might vary, but it usually indicates an issue with the merging of the main manifest and the Expo manifest. This might result from conflicts in the application ID, package name, or other attributes between the two manifests. This error might happen in different stages of building the app: during the build process itself, during the signing process, or when running the app on an emulator or device. It can be particularly troublesome to debug because the error message doesn't always pinpoint the exact cause.
